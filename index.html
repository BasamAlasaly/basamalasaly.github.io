      <h4>Sustainable Shipping</h4>
      <img src="images/shipwise.webp" alt="ShipWise Logo">
      <p>ShipWise is an iOS eCommerce app I developed with two primary goals in mind. The first goal is to help reduce environmental carbon emissions by donating 1% of gross revenue to environmental causes. The second goal is to provide significant discounts on shipping labels, offering an incentive for users to choose ShipWise.</p> 
      
      <p>I developed the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this application in one week. ShipWise reflects a personal dedication to both environmental sustainability and providing value to users.</p>

      <h2>Daily Astronomy</h2>
      <h4>Leveraging NASA's APOD API</h4>
      <img src="images/daily_astronomy.webp" alt="Daily Astronomy Logo">
      <p>I developed an iOS application using SwiftUI 2.0 that leverages NASA's renowned Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. This popular API showcases stunning daily astronomy photos from NASA and allows users to retrieve images from previous dates. The app is free and offers a captivating way for users to explore the wonders of our universe through NASA's lens, complete with new widget support for a more dynamic home screen experience.</p>

      <h2>Arizona State University Applied Project</h2>
      <h4>Leveraging Hyperledger Fabric</h4>
      <img src="images/hyperledger_fabric.webp" alt="Hyperledger Fabric Logo">
      <p>I participated in a collaborative blockchain research project for a medical devices company, utilizing Hyperledger Fabric to enhance supply chain management. The project involved detailed research, development, and testing to explore the practical applications of blockchain technology in the industry. We focused on improving device location tracking, managing expiration dates, and streamlining the consignment device reordering process.</p>
      
      <p>Through meetings with corporate representatives and healthcare personnel, I gained valuable insights into the industrial supply chain and helped create efficient workflows to identify key data areas. Our efforts culminated in a successful proof of concept, demonstrating the benefits and capabilities of blockchain technology in real-world scenarios.</p>

      <h2>LeukApp: Decision Support Web App</h2>
      <h4>React App Usability Testing and Technical Revisions for HonorHealth</h4>
      <img src="images/leukapp.webp" alt="LeukApp Logo">
      <p>LeukApp is a clinical decision support web application designed to assist physicians in the risk assessment and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. My role in this project involved evaluating LeukApp's usability following third-party development and implementing necessary modifications or enhancements to optimize its functionality. This project was a collaborative research effort between ASU and HonorHealth, aimed at aiding physicians' decision-making and resident training.</p>
      
      <p>I was a presenter for the LeukApp project at the <a href="https://symposium2019.zerista.com/event/member/602495" target="_blank">AMIA 2019 Annual Symposium</a>, where it was well received during a productive poster presentation session. Through my user testing with oncologists, fellows, and clinical administrators, I gained valuable insights into the importance of usability and UI/UX testing for ensuring end-user satisfaction and effectiveness in healthcare applications. This experience underscored the critical role of user-centered design in the development of clinical decision support tools.</p>

      <h3>December, 2021</h3>
      <h2>DeFi Dashboard</h2>
      <h4>First Native DeFi iOS Dashboard</h4>
      <img src="images/defi_dashboard.webp" alt="DeFi Dashboard Logo">
      <p>DeFi Dashboard was an iOS application developed using Apple's native SwiftUI and Swift. The app leveraged the <a href="https://cloud.debank.com/" target="_blank">DeBank API</a> to retrieve and display user balances in decentralized crypto assets and protocols, and reached community partner status with <a href="https://www.nftport.xyz/" target="_blank">NFTPort</a> (which ceased operations on 5/26/2024) to enhance its features.</p>
      <p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was developed in under two weeks. Due to its rapid growth, sustaining the application proved challenging from the high costs associated with API usage.</p>

      <h3>June, 2020</h3>
      <h2>BankFolio</h2>
      <h4>Fintech iOS Mobile Application for Personal Finance Management</h4>
      <img src="images/bankfolio.webp" alt="BankFolio Logo">
      <p>I bootstrapped BankFolio using Apple's native SwiftUI and Swift, leveraging <a href="https://www.plaid.com/" target="_blank">Plaid API</a> to retrieve and display user bank account information and accompanying transactions in one place. I came across this idea when I got charged for subscriptions I forgot I had signed up for and wished there was an easier way to spot those transactions quicker at the time. After coming across Plaid's API and doing some research, I found apps out there offering this service for an average price of $6 a month, which is overpriced. The target audience for this type of application is looking to save money rather than spend it. I decided to provide this app to users at a near net operating cost based on their number of connected accounts so more people can take advantage of these features as they deserve to control their hard-earned money.</p>
      <p>In 2022, BankFolio underwent an unsuccessful acquisition that ironically adversely impacted the company's financial health, primarily due to the integration of costly services, such as <a href="https://www.mx.com/" target="_blank">MX Finance</a>, without corresponding marketing strategies initiation.</p>

      <h2>Mystery Math</h2>
      <h4>Educational iOS Mobile Application for Kids</h4>
      <img src="images/mystery_math.webp" alt="Mystery Math Logo">
      <p>An iOS application I built with Swift 5 code using Nodes, array algorithm manipulations (a ton of math validations) and the SpriteKit framework on Xcode. The goal of this application is to teach kids addition, subtraction, multiplication, and addition with different levels. They can create their own game by picking which operations to test themselves on, and they can track their high score for a continuous record to beat.</p>
