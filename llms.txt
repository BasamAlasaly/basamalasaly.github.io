# Basam Alasaly's Personal Website

> Personal portfolio website featuring a modern 6-card grid homepage design showcasing projects, research work, and professional background in biomedical informatics, iOS development, and healthcare technology. Built with glassmorphism design principles and full mobile responsiveness.

This is the personal website of Basam Alasaly, a Research Coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania's AI-4-AI Lab and aspiring physician-scientist. The site features a complete redesign with a full-screen 6-card grid navigation system inspired by Jonathan Patterson's aesthetic.

The homepage showcases a unique navigation approach with a 3x2 grid covering the entire viewport, featuring a special profile card (top-left) with personal information and quote, and individual cards for Projects, Research, About, and Contact sections. The design implements glassmorphism effects with backdrop-blur, hover animations, and a consistent green accent color (#5FF280).
